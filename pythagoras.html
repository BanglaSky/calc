  <h2>What is Pythagoras' theorem</h2>
       <p>Pythagoras' Theorem is the idea that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal in area to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.</p> 
       <h3>What is a hypotenuse?</h3>
    <p>The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right-angled triangle.</p>
 <h4>How to find the hypotenuse<h4>    
    <p>You can compare all the sides of the triangle to find the longest side</p>
  <p>Or you can use the formula "a² + b² = c²"and then square root the whole thing</p>
